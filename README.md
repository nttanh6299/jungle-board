## Running app locally

First thing to run is to download the code by cloning the repository:

```cli
git clone git@github.com:nttanh6299/jungle-board.git

If you get `Permission denied` error using `ssh`, use `https` link as a fallback:

```cli
git clone https://github.com/nttanh6299/jungle-board.git
```

##### The project has three installation steps:

##### Root

Root directory contains editor configuration, and both the server and client folder:

```cli
yarn install
```

##### Server

The api server, I use `Nodejs` to power my server:

```cli
cd packages/server
yarn install
```

##### Client

Frontend SPA folder using `Nextjs`:

```cli
cd packages/client
yarn install
```

If you standing in the server folder, try to use `cd ../server`

##### Don't forget to add your .env file, it contains all of things that are considered secret there.
